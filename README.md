The ipython notebook pandas_intro.ipynb provides a basic introduction
to pandas using Environment Canada weather station data.  The EC data
has to be downloaded first from the link provided at the top of the
notebook.

The shell script get_ec_stn_data.sh will allow you to automatically download multiple
years worth of data, if you have an interest in pursuing further analyses.
You can also explore the data at:
